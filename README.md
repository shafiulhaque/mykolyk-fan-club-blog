## Mykolyk Fan Club Blog
What if you could share your thoughts with the world? Well, then why not use a blog? The Mykolyk Fan Club has come together to create a blog website, where users can post their blog entries to the world, edit their own entries, and view the entries of other users. Cookies are used to save the login information of a user when they are logged in. Each blog is stored in a database with a unique ID. On the home page, everyone’s blog entries appear, and if you click on someone’s profile, information about their account along with their blog entries appears. 

Data for users and blogs would be stored through SQLite with the discobandit.db database and the website would be run with Flask through init.py (the main python file with routes and links) and db.py (with SQLite functions). There are different html files for different webpages that the user can be on, and information is sent from one page through another with GET and POST Requests. There are buttons on each page as well as URLs that a user can use to navigate from one page to another. 

Imagination is yours for the taking. Clone the repository, run the app, and enjoy!
